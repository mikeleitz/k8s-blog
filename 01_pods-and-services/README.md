# Overview

This directory has the instructions and relevant manifests for the blog entries to run on your custom RaspberryPi k8s cluster.

Each blog entry corresponds to a subdirectory.

# Notes

Make sure you read the README.md in each subdirectory.  

The manifests won't likely run as it and you'll need to substitute relevant information in the manifest for it to work correctly.  Things like ip address for example.
